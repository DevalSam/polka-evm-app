# 🔮 Solidity Frontend Library for Polkadot Developers

A lightweight, plug-and-play frontend library designed to help Polkadot developers interact seamlessly with Solidity smart contracts deployed on EVM-compatible parachains like Moonbeam, Astar, and EdgeEVM.

---

## 🚀 Overview
![App_Preview](src/IMG/cam2.png)
This library bridges the familiar Solidity development experience with the Polkadot ecosystem. Whether you're deploying new contracts or building UIs that interact with existing EVM-based contracts, this toolset makes it easy to connect, deploy, and interact — all using React components powered by Polkadot.js and ethers.js.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🌐 Connect to EVM-compatible parachains (Moonbeam, Astar, Edgeware, etc.)
- 👛 Wallet support: MetaMask, Polkadot.js Extension
- ⚡ Deploy & interact with Solidity smart contracts
- 🔍 Auto-generated UI from ABI
- 🧠 Polkadot-aware tools and metadata support
- 🔧 Developer-friendly utilities (gas estimator, ABI playground, etc.)

---

## 🧩 UI Components

- `<NetworkSelector />` – Select and connect to supported parachains
- `<WalletConnector />` – Connect via MetaMask or Polkadot.js Extension
- `<ContractDeployer />` – Deploy Solidity smart contracts (ABI + bytecode)
- `<ContractInterface />` – Interact with deployed contracts
- `<AbiPlayground />` – Encode/decode contract calls, estimate gas, etc.

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install @your-scope/polkadot-solidity-ui
# or
yarn add @your-scope/polkadot-solidity-ui
```

---

## 🛠️ Usage

```tsx
import {
  NetworkSelector,
  WalletConnector,
  ContractDeployer,
  ContractInterface
} from '@your-scope/polkadot-solidity-ui';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <NetworkSelector />
      <WalletConnector />
      <ContractDeployer />
      <ContractInterface />
    </div>
  );
}
```
